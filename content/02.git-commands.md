# Git Commands


Before diving into Git commands, it’s essential to understand the three key stages where your files exist and evolve in Git: Untracked (in the Working Directory), Staged, and Committed.

**Untracked (Working Directory)**: This is where your project files are stored and where you make changes, create new files, or delete files. Initially, files in this stage are not yet tracked by Git.

**Staged**: The staging area acts as a “to-do list” for Git. Here, you prepare specific changes you want to include in your next snapshot (commit). Changes are moved to the staging area using the `git add` command.

**Committed**: Once changes are committed, they are saved permanently in the repository (a database) where Git tracks all your project files and their version history.

### Basic Commands

1. Initialize a Repository
- `git init`: Creates a new git repository in the current folder.

Example:  
 ```bash
 git init
```


1. Configure User Info
- `git config`: Sets up your name and email for commits.

Example:  
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```    


>[!note]
>The `--global` option configures your username and email for all Git repositories on your system. If you use `--local` instead, it will configure the username and email only for the current project. 
### **Working with Files**

1. Stage Changes
- `git add`: Stages your file you are working on for the next commit.

Example:  
```bash
git add file.txt
```

Before running the `git add` command, your changes will be in the **working directory**.

After running the `git add` command, your changes will be moved to **staged**.

>[!NOTE]
> To stage all files in the directory, use `git add`.

1. Remove Files
- `git rm`: Removes files from the project and stages the deletion.

Example:  
```bash
git rm file.txt
```  
>[!Note]
> - If you run this command, you can see this file has changes staged and you can use the option `--cached` to keep the file or `-f` to force removal.
> - `--cached` option removes the file only from the staging area while keeping it in your working directory.

3. Move or Rename Files 
- `git mv`: Renames `oldname.txt` to `newname.txt` and stages the change. 

Example:
```bash
git mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

4. Check Working Directory Status
- `git status`: Show the status of your working directory and staging area, showing which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked.


Example:  
```bash
git status
```

5. Show Changes 
- `git diff`: Used to show the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

Example:  
 ```bash
 git diff
 ```

### Committing Changes & Viewing History

1. Commit Changes
- `git commit`: Saves staged changes to the repository with a message, e.g. "Initial commit".

Example:  
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

In Git, the first commit in a repository is automatically associated with a branch. By default, our branch here is named  **master** (though newer Git versions use main). A branch in Git is simply a movable pointer to a commit, starting with the initial commit and extending forward as new commits are added.

In addition to branches, there is a special pointer called the `HEAD`, which always points to the current commit you are at.

![git-head](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ed51cb-9c13-4ac6-89ef-c69c7abe5427)

When you create new commits, the `HEAD` will move to the latest commit in the current branch.

1. Modify the Last Commit 
- `git commit --amend`: Updates the last commit message or includes additional changes and replaces the previous commit with a new one.
  
Example:
 ```bash
  git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"
 ```

3. View Commit History 
- `git log`: Shows the history of commits.

Example:  
```bash
git log
```  

4. Identify who Changed what

- `git blame`: Shows who made changes to each line of the file.

Example:  
```bash
git blame filename
```
      
5. Tag a Commit
- `git tag`: Used to mark specific points in your project's history, often for releases e.g., (v1.0). Tags are like labels for commits, making it easier to reference them later.

Example:
- Creates a lightweight tag v1.0 at the latest commit.
```bash
git tag v1.0
```  
- Create an Annotated Tag (with a description).
```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
```
- List all tags.
```bash
git tag
```

### Branching & Merging

1. Manage Branches

- `git branch`: Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Example:
- Create a Branch
```bash
git branch feature-branch
```


<img width="1000" height="600" alt="Artboard 4" src="/content/images/git-commands-branch.jpg" />    


- List Branches
```bash
git branch
```

1. Switch Branches 
- `git checkout`: Used to switch between branches or revert files to a previous state.

Example:
- Switch to an existing Branch and make it the active branch.
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

The `HEAD` always refers to "where-you-at" currently, so when you use the `git checkout` command, you change the position of the `HEAD` from pointing to the `master` to pointing to the new branch, e.g, `feature-branch`. Which means any commit is currently made will be created on the `feature-branch`.


- Create and switch to a new Branch and immediately switch to it.
```bash
git checkout -b newbranch-name
```
- Restores the files from the given commit to your working directory
```bash
git checkout commitID -- filename
```

3. Merge Branches  
- `git merge`: Combines changes from one branch into another.
  
Example:
- Merge a branch into the current Branch.  
```bash
 git merge feature-branch
```    
<img width="1000" height="600" alt="Artboard 4" src="/content/images/git-commands-merge.jpg" />     

- `git merge --abort`: Cancels an ongoing merge if there are conflicts with option `--abort`
   
```bash
git merge --abort
```  

      
### Undoing & Cleaning

1. Unstage or Reset Commits  
- `git reset`:  Removes files from the staging area, but keeps changes in the working directory.

Examples

- unstage a file.
```bash
git reset filename
```

- `git reset --soft`: Moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit but keeps all changes in the staging area (ready for commit).

```bash

git reset --soft <commitID>
```

- `git reset --mixed <commitID>` or just `git reset <commitID>`: Moves HEAD to the specified commit and unstages any changes used when you want to undo a commit.

```bash
git reset --mixed 9a6add8
```


2. Restore Files 
- `git restore`: Restores files to their previous state.

Example:  
```bash
git restore filename
```  
   

3. Remove Untracked Files  
- `git clean`: Deletes all untracked files from the working directory.

Example:  
```bash
git clean -f
```
